# other ways to replace besides mean
# median - might be better than mean depending on breakdown of outliers
# further categorize mean/median - look at median survival age and median non-survival age, and how strongly correlated with other factors, such as cabin, sex, 
#   socioeconomic status, etc. and apply the specific mean that most closely defines specific row.

# Individual's without cabin possibly crew of ship...roughly 300 crew makes logical sense in terms of numbers
# Does not make sense to replace if no cabin indicates crew.  Crew should have own category

# adding has_cabin_number
